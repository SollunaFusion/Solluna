                    <p> Dancing has always felt like the most natural state of being for Beth. Growing up, she danced her way across living rooms, gym courts, and theater stages. Beth started dancing Lindy Hop college and quickly fell in love with social dance. Three years ago, Beth began dancing blues and fusion where she experienced blissful connections and new freedom. In her classes, she would like to inspire deeper connections and foster creative movements so that dancers feel closer to themselves and those around them.

She brings additional influence to her fusion lessons from a variety of social dances, including blues, salsa, kizomba, contact improv, and tango. She believes that dance is one of the best forms of exercise for mind, body, and soul, and hopes to inspire others to connect in deeper ways.
